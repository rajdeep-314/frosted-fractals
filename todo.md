# To do

- Comment the code in `individuals/code`
- Check if all the code snippets are working - ALL of them
- Make the repo public
- Put the color maps in a common location, maybe in `utils.py`
- Organize plans a little
- Comment everything
    - Update the existing comments too
- Maybe change the `plot_pts` function and it's calls and explicitly call with the surface as a parameter
- Start working on the Snowmandelbrot
- Maybe make a module `chaotic_gens.py`
