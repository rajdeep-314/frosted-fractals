# To do

- Organize plans a little
- Comment everything
    - Update the existing comments too
- Maybe change the `plot_pts` function and it's calls and explicitly call with the surface as a parameter
- Start working on the Snowmandelbrot
- Maybe make a module `chaotic_gens.py`
<!-- - Maybe generate points for koch segment and then use fill inside the polygon (redacted, for now) -->
