# Sierpinski Tree

## The fractals involved

The *Sierpinski Tree*, as the name suggests, is largely made of Sierpinksi fractals:
- It's trunk is a Sierpinski carpet, generated using chaos game, with the following specification
    - `main.py`: 1,00,000 points
    - `sv-main.py`: 7,50,000 points
- It's leaves are 3 Sierpinksi triangles, stacked on top of each other, with the number of points in each triangle being
    - `main.py`: 2,00,000 points
    - `sv-main.py`: 20,00,000 points
